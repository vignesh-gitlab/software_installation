1. Static IP -(how to map static IP using EIP(Elastic IP))
   * Default for one account and one AZ we can create 5 EIP's
   * want more go to support centre and raise a request under "service limit increse"
2. Add Extra Storgae or Extra Volume (EBS- Elastic Block Store)
3. Modify the volume size - upto 16 TB (Increase or Decrease)
   (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/volume_limits.html)
4. Snapshot (Take Backup of specific drive/volume)
   *Migrate the date into different machine(new machine) using snapshot

Linux command:
**************
1.# df -h (to view the linux file system)
add volume and attach to the linux machine
2.# lsblk (to list the file system)
3.# file -s /dev/xvdb(to view the file inside the drive or to check the volume has any data.) 
  *output-/dev/xvdf: data - it means there is no data inside the drive
4.# mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb (format the volume to ext4 filesystem)
5.# mkdir demo (to create folder or directory)
6.# mount /dev/xvdb demo (mount the file(/demo) to the directory(/dev/xvdf))
  # df -h
7.# resize2fs /dev/xvdb (to resize the volume to take effect)
  # ps -ef | grep httpd
