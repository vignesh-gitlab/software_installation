DNS-Domain Name System

EC2 --> Server ---> App host

DNS:
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet
when users type domain names such as google.com or amazon.com
into web browsers, DNS is responsible for finding the correct 
IP address for those sites.

DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. 
DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), 
or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

What i need to setup DNS:

1.Server-->Public IP
2.Application
3.DNS

Steps to setup DNS:

1.Buy a DNS
2.Register into cloud ---Naming Servers
3.Map into my server IP 

In AWS:
1.Register Domain - Buya a domain
2.Hosted Zone ---> NS
3.Record set


1.Register Domain:
cloudpy.co.in

2.Hosted Zone ---> NS
ns-2031.awsdns-61.co.uk.
ns-831.awsdns-39.net.
ns-296.awsdns-37.com.
ns-1457.awsdns-54.org.

3.Record set
IP address


Routing Policy:
1.Simply routing
2.Failover routing policy
3.Geolocation routing policy
4.Latency routing policy
5.Weighted routing policy

1.Simple routing policy – Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, 
for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website.

2.Failover routing policy – Use when you want to configure active-passive failover.

3.Geolocation routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users.

4.Latency routing policy – Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic 
to the Region that provides the best latency with less round-trip time.

5.Weighted routing policy – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.

6.Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route 53 to respond 
to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random.
