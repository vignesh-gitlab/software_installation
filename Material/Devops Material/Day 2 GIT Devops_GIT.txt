- Git is a free, open source distributed version control system tool.

Version Control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large websites and other collection of information.
There are two types of VCS: 
- Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
- Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

CVCS: 
- Uses a central server to store all files 
- It works on a single repository to which users can directly access.
Disadvantages:
- It is not locally available
- Need to be connected to a network.
- Any case of the central server getting crashed or corrupted will result in losing the entire data of the project.

DVCS:
- Systems do not necessarily rely on a central server for storage.
- Every contributor has a local copy or “clone” [Local Repository] of the main repository.
- Push/Pull of data allowed apart from Commit/Update.
Advantage:
- Very fast, as no Remote rather Clone will be in local.
- Commit can be done locally.
- In case of the central server crash, the lost data can be easily recovered from any one of the contributor’s Clone.
