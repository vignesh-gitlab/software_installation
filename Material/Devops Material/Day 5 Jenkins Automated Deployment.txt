Automation Deployment:

	It is a process of Automating the Deployment process in a Continuous Delivery System.


Main Stages in Continuous Delivery & Deployment Pipelines:


Build --> Deploy --> Test --> Release

- These are Chained Processes, 
- It means when the Build is success, then only Deploy will get started, 
- Same like seeing the success of Deployment, the Testing happens. 
- Also after every job, will have a notification, which tell us about its status

This is called as "Continuous Integrated Sytem"


Step 1 -- Start the Jenkins and login into the console

Step 2 -- Install Deploy Plugins called as "Deploy to container"

Step 3 -- Create a Build Job in Jenkins

Step 4 -- Add Post build Action - Deploy war/ear to container, Choose container, credentials.

Step 5 -- In tomcat-users.xml [under /opt/apache-tomcat-7.0.91/conf] add user for DEPLOYMENT [Install TOMCAT before that]

   <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
   <role rolename="manager-script"/>
   <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
   <role rolename="manager-status"/>
   <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status"/>
   <user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>


Step 6 -- Place the war file in the appropirate path.
		eg: /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/AutoDeployment/sample.war

Step 7 -- Run & Validate.

Step 8 -- WAR should be available under the tomcat's webapps folder.

============================================================================================

TOMCAT Installation:

Step 1 -- Goto the link https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi & donwload the binaries[tar.gz under CORE].

Step 2 -- Once the file [apache-tomcat-7.0.91.tar] is downloaded, move it to the server.

Step 3 -- Copy it to the /opt location in the server.

Step 4 -- untar the file -> tar zxvf <filename>

Step 5 -- delete the .gz file. 

Step 6 -- Goto to the bin path and start tomcat - startup.sh

============================================================================================

logs--->Apache Tomcat related logs
webapps--->Deployed application available
conf--->Apache related configuration file
bin---> Apache start and stop available here
